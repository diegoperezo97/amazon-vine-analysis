# Big Data

Nowadays "Big Data" is a popular term but how would you characterize it if I asked you? We'll look at what big data implies in the industry in this subject. We'll look at Hadoop, the four Vs, MapReduce, and Spark as part of the big data ecosystem. Natural language processing will also be discussed. This is when we translate what we say into a language that computers can understand. Because there is so much spoken and written language that has to be translated, natural language processing is a vital big data idea and skill set. Spam filters, spell check, and voice recognition systems all involve natural language processing. Let's dive into the exciting realm of big data.

## Overview of the Analysis

* BigMarket, a startup that helps firms enhance their marketing efforts, has hired me as their first data specialist. In addition, I was employed just in time.
* One of BigMarket's clients has asked for some serious data. Sellby is preparing to launch a vast product catalog on a popular retail website. They want to see how their product reviews compare to similar items supplied by rivals. They're also considering joining a program that provides free items to select reviewers, but they want to know if the investment is worthwhile.
* There are hundreds of reviews, all of which are written in words rather than numbers, so you'll have to translate them before you can examine them.
* BigMarket was recruited by Sellby because they believe in the value of big data. It's now up to you to use that authority to benefit your customer.

### Purpose
* Help Sellby determine how the reviews of their products compare to the reviews of similar products sold by their competitors, as well as determine if enrolling in a program that gives out free products to select reviewers is worth the cost.

Given the results presented in Image 1. Results for the Vine Program and Image 2. Results non-related to the Vine Porgram, the following results can be concluded:

Table 1. Consolidated results of Vine Program

| METRIC | VINE PROGRAM | NOT VINE PROGRAM
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------
| Total number of reviews | 94 | 39,915
| Total number of five star reviews | 48 | 15,556
| Percentage of five star reviews | 51.06% | 39.98%

## Summary of the Analysis

* Given the results presented in Table 1. Consolidated results of Vine Program, we can conclude that even though five-star results for the Vine Program are higher (51% compared to 39%), Vine Program results only account for 0.23% of total reviews and 0.31% of five-star reviews. Given the contribution of the Vine Program in relation to the whole picture, there is not enough evidence to conclude that Vine Program results in happier customers, as it might be the case that Vine Program impacts on customers not leaving comments. I would suggest to further evaluate this issue.
